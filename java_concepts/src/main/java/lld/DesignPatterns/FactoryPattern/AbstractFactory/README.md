# Simple Factory Pattern for Notification System

## Problem Statement

You are designing a notification system. Depending on the type of notification (e.g., email, SMS, push notification), different notification routines are required. You need a way to create notifications without explicitly specifying their classes, ensuring the system is open for future notification types.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement the Simple Factory pattern to create notifications in the notification system. The Simple Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic, allowing for easy addition of new notification types.
