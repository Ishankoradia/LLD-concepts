# Facade pattern for a travel booking platform

## Problem Statement
You are working on an online booking platform for travel accommodations. The platform needs to handle bookings, payments, and notifications through different external services. The goal is to provide a simplified interface for customers and internal modules to perform booking-related tasks without directly dealing with the intricacies of each external service.

## Assignment
Your task is to implement the Facade pattern to refactor the existing `BookingManager` class. The `BookingManager` class has multiple dependencies and methods that handle bookings, payments, and notifications. Your goal is to create a facade class that provides a unified and simplified interface for these complex operations.
