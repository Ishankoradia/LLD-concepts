# Adapter Pattern for Social Media Aggregator

## Problem Statement
You are working on a social media aggregator app that pulls in posts from various social platforms. Each platform provides data in different structures through distinct APIs. Your task is to unify the data format within the app and ensure that integrating new social platforms remains hassle-free. To achieve this, you want to implement the Adapter pattern, allowing you to create adapter classes for different social media platform APIs. These adapters will convert platform-specific APIs into a common format that your application can use.

## Assignment
Your goal is to implement the Adapter pattern to create adapter classes for different social media platform APIs. These adapters should conform to a common interface, making it easy to integrate new platforms in the future. Your task is to abstract away the differences in APIs and data formats and provide a unified interface for your application to work with.
